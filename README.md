### Lesson 1. Introduction and Drawing
- What is programming?
- What is P5JS?

### Lesson 2. Animation
- Program flow (what's a function?)
  - Setup, draw, and other events
  - Variation: mouseX and mouseY
- More about variables
  - make your own variables (numbers and strings)
  - JS objects (variables inside variables)

### Lesson 3. Interaction 
- Conditional Statements
    - Boolean expressions
    - if statement
    - relational operators
    - Case study: bouncing ball
    - else, else if, and, or 
    - buttons, rollovers, switches 
- Loops (while and for)
    - while and for 
    - nested loops

### Lesson 4. Functions: the basics
- Calling vs. defining
- Modularity
- Arguments and parameters
- Re-usability
- Return types
- Recursion
- Functions inside objects
- **Homework:** TBA (but something like use a function to draw a design different ways, multiple times. Make a previous sketch modular.)

### Lesson 5. Objects and Arrays
- Review object literals:
    - properties - name/value pairs
    - functions inside objects
    - `this` keyword
- What is an array?
    - declaring, intializing
    - numeric indices
    - arrays and for loops
    - `length` property
- An array of objects!
- Constructor function! 
- Adding and deleting from an array, `push()` and `splice()`
- Multiple JS files
- Clicking on objects 
- Checking objects intersecting with other objects
- Loading images for objects

### Lesson 6. DOM: Events and Callbacks
- Review events -- mousePressed, keyPressed
- Beyond the Canvas, using p5.dom
- Intro to HTML/CSS basics
- DOM elements - p5.dom reference
    - `createP()`
    - `createButton()`
    - `createSlider()`
- Callbacks
    - `button.mousePressed(callback);`
- `style()` -- low key intro to CSS
- [CSS Reference](http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/css/propindex/all.htm)

### Lesson 7. Data
- Loading external data with p5.js
- Data and APIs
- JSON and APIs (and more on callbacks!)
- Word Counting

### Lesson 8. Video and Sound *

### Lesson 9. Mobile *

### Lesson 10. Interfacing with Hardware *
